The product is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of the RNA from SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19).The molecular test uses a single step real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) process in lower respiratory tract fluids and upper respiratory tract fluids from patients who meet the clinical criteria COVID-19. These include fever, cough, shortness of breath and travel history to China.Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions, the company adds.However, shares in CODX plunged 8% in Tuesday’s trading, and fell a further 1.4% after-hours on a bout of profit-taking after the stock’s steep climb on Monday.The stock rallied 28% following the announcement that the company’s partner, Clinical Reference Laboratory (CRL), received Emergency Use Authorization from the US FDA for CRL Rapid Response, a saliva-based COVID-19 test that can be self-administered at home, and then tested using Co-Diagnostics’ patented CoPrimer technology.“We believe that CRL’s selection of the Co-Diagnostics platform, and their successful emergency use authorization from the FDA, speaks volumes about the quality, sensitivity, and specificity of our CoPrimer primer and probe technology,” remarked Dwight Egan, CEO of Co-Diagnostics.Indeed shares in Co-Diagnostics have exploded over 3000% year-to-date, and the stock still maintains a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus. That’s alongside an average analyst price target of $34 (19% upside potential).“Logix Smart COVID-19 test’s high accuracy [has been] independently validated for multiple times” comments HC Wainwright analyst Yi Chen, adding that time to detection is just 63-90 minutes. With the U.S. continuing to record over 60,000 new cases of Covid-19 daily Chen expects Co-Diagnostics to continue to provide its partners with large volumes of its Logix Smart Covid-19 test kits.The analyst reiterated his buy rating on the stock with a $35 price target following the approval of the company’s self-collecting Covid-19 saliva test.

The Street consensus was for $6.6 million. LivePerson (LPSN) also raised its full year 2020 revenue guidance to a range of $357 million to $361 million, up from previous guidance of $340 million to $355 million. Analysts had forecast $347.45 million. For the third quarter, the company expects to generate $92 million-$93 million, which is above the analyst consensus of $89.35 million.In addition, LivePerson is targeting full-year growth of 22% to 24%, up from 17% to 22% previously. LivePerson is helping companies to better communicate with customers through its AI-based communication platform. The coronavirus pandemic has forced multiple call centers around the world to change their work mode from office- to-home, which in turn has boosted demand for the company’s services.“We expect that our focus on internal automation and a tight discipline around expense controls will enable the company to continuing driving year-over-year profit improvements and margin expansion even while investing in key growth drivers of AI, product innovation, go-to-market capacity and tech infrastructure,” the company said in a statement. “LivePerson is entering the second half of 2020 with a favorable backdrop comprised of strong year-to-date contract signings, better-than-anticipated conversation volumes on our platform and a robust sales pipeline.”LivePerson added that it “continues to balance this strengthening outlook with a healthy respect for the potential risks that may arise from a poor macroeconomic environment.”Following the guidance, Needham analyst Ryan MacDonald ramped up the stock’s price target to $60 (30% upside potential) from $33 and reiterated a Buy rating, saying that the company is “firing on all cylinders.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly driven increased volumes within the contact center, requiring businesses to expand the number of channels through which they can interact with consumers,” MacDonald wrote in a note to investors. “We expect LPSN to remain a key beneficiary and continue to accelerate top line growth into FY21, while also improving leverage in the model.”The rest of the Street shares MacDonald’s bullish outlook. The Strong Buy analyst consensus boasts 9 Buys versus 2 Holds. With shares up 25% so far this year, the $47.70 average price target implies a modest 3.2% upside potential to current levels.

Novavax has rallied more than 4,300% so far this year on speculation about the potential for its vaccine.Results presented on Tuesday evening from a two-injection regimen when administered concurrently with Novavax’s immune-boosting technology generated antibody responses that were four times higher than those seen in people who had recovered from the disease. Some of the healthy adults in the study experienced side effects including fever, headache and fatigue.Confusion over the vaccine’s safety data arose after a media report incorrectly said trial participants were hospitalized with severe reactions. The vaccine appeared safe in the more than 100 patients who received it, according to the company. Reactions to the shots were generally mild, lasting two days or less. One patient getting the vaccine had a mild skin infection that was determined not to be related to the shot.Gregory Glenn, Novavax’s head of research and development, said adverse events were “sporadic” and spread across placebo as well as vaccinated patients in the study.Responses were similar across doses, meaning it may be easier for Novavax to manufacture. Dosing has been a key advantage the company has been touting along with less stringent guidelines on temperature, considering the widespread need for shots. There are more than 160 different shots in various stages of testing: Novavax joins the ranks of AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc. as well as Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE which have all reported Phase 1 results from their inoculations.The results were enough for JPMorgan analyst Eric Joseph to raise his rating to overweight from neutral and set a Street high price target of $275. “We’d still caution against reading too concretely across the various CoV2 vaccine datasets,” he wrote in a client note, though its not a stretch to conclude neutralizing antibody activity of NVX-CoV2373 “looks best-in-class.” Five analysts rate Novavax a buy, while one recommends selling the stock.Novavax’s reputation got a boost in early July when the biotechnology company secured a $1.6 billion contract from the U.S. government under Operation Warp Speed. It was the largest U.S. award until a $2.1 billion award to Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline Plc topped it a few weeks later. A former Glaxo executive, Moncef Slaoui, heads Operation Warp Speed.

Swelling optimism that loss-making Sea may one day become both the Tencent and Alibaba of Southeast Asia has boosted its New York-listed shares by more than 880% in the past 18 months, the largest gain worldwide among companies with a starting market value of at least $1 billion. Short sellers who placed record wagers against the stock in June are retreating at an unprecedented pace.If Sea Chief Executive Officer Forrest Li is paying attention to any of this, he’s not letting on. The 42-year-old billionaire said in a video interview that he’s been working seven-day weeks in the office since April, leading his company through what may be its most pivotal year. Demand for Sea’s mobile games and online-shopping platform has surged during the pandemic, and the company is bidding on a Singapore digital-banking license to accelerate its push into financial services. Li is also looking for potential acquisitions in gaming, logistics and e-commerce.“We don’t like to think too much about our success or how we got here,” he said when asked about Sea’s stock price. “It doesn’t matter if the environment is good or bad. It doesn’t change a company or a person.”Even by the standards of today’s tech boom, Li’s ascent has been remarkable. Born in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, he worked for the local units of Motorola Solutions Inc. and Corning Inc. before enrolling in Stanford’s MBA program. He founded Sea, then known as Garena, in 2009 and took it public with backing from Tencent in 2017.Read more about Li, who named himself after Forrest Gump.After a rocky first year of trading, Sea’s stock has gone on to trounce everything in its class. Initially, the gains were fueled by the runaway success of Sea’s first self-made mobile game -- a battle royale called Free Fire that has attracted as many as 80 million daily active users in more than 130 markets.But Sea’s e-commerce and financial services units are now increasingly important pillars of the bull case. Its Shopee platform overtook Alibaba’s Lazada in the fourth quarter of 2019 to become the top e-commerce provider in Southeast Asia, according to research firm iPrice, and the business accounted for more than 40% of Sea’s revenue in 2019, up from 2.3% in 2017.SeaMoney, which offers everything from e-wallets to micro loans, could ultimately be just as large, according to Li. “We think this is a huge business opportunity,” he said.Read more: Sea’s Singapore Digital Bank Bid Targets Millennials, SMEsThe soft-spoken founder has some big-name believers.

Other prominent shareholders include Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management LLC and Kora Management LP, an emerging markets-focused hedge fund in New York, according to regulatory filings as of March.Kora began investing in Sea in early 2018 after meeting with Li, Daniel Jacobs, the hedge fund’s founding partner, said in an interview. “We’ve seen over the last two years a company that’s got a great team and great products going after a big market and just executing incredibly well,” he said. “We think this is a mini Tencent and has the ability to be a really successful, large company in a global context.”Sea has already claimed the title of biggest company in Southeast Asia after its market value swelled to $65 billion, topping DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and PT Bank Central Asia for the first time earlier this year. Revenue has also grown quickly, jumping 163% to $2.2 billion in 2019, though it’s still just a fraction of DBS’s $11 billion.As for Sea’s $1.46 billion net loss last year? Jacobs isn’t bothered by it. “They are thoughtful and prudent about building a business,” he said. “We are very much of the view that the company has all this under control.”Not everyone is convinced.DBS Bank Ltd. analyst Sachin Mittal downgraded his recommendation on Sea to sell in July, citing Indonesia’s new tax regulations for cross-border transactions and the likelihood of the company burning through cash to grow its payments business. “There is a tech bubble right now,” he said in an interview. “Sea’s stock is overvalued and it��s partly a reflection of the industry.”While short sellers have closed out bets against Sea at a rapid clip in recent weeks, they still have a bearish position worth more than $3 billion, or about 8% of the stock’s free float, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. “Mark-to-market losses may have forced shorts out of their position,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3. “But they may still have a negative outlook.”Skeptics note that Sea faces deep-pocketed competitors in all of its main businesses, from Lazada to Grab Holdings Inc. and a slew of other up-and-comers in digital finance.

pet insurance provider Trupanion (TRUP) are rising 5% in Wednesday’s pre-market trading after the company reported a clean beat-and-raise quarter.Specifically, Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.04 beat Street estimates by $0.06 while revenue of $117.9M beat by $3.2M- and represented a 27.9% year-over-year increase. Subscription business revenue was $92.5M (beating the consensus of $92.1M), up 19% from the same period last year.TRUP also reported total enrolled pets of 744,727 at June 30, 2020, up 29% year-over-year, with Pet Acquisition Cost (PAC) down 7% year-over-year to $199 as Net Additions accelerated to 28% (vs. 0.5% in Q1). Meanwhile Q2 Monthly Retention Rate came in at 98.66%, an all-time-high, driven by Trupanion Express and improved customer service.“Across key financial and operational metrics, it was a very strong quarter for Trupanion,” said Darryl Rawlings, CEO of Trupanion. “I’m particularly proud of our service levels we provided to our members, which contributed to records in monthly average retention and the number of pet owners adding pets or referring friends to Trupanion in the quarter.”For the full year, management raised Revenue guidance to $487-$491M (vs. $471-$478M prior) and Adj Operating Income guidance to $56M (vs. $55M prior).Following the report RBC Capital’s Shweta Khajuria reiterated her buy rating on the stock with a $62 price target up from $51 previously.

Against the backdrop of weak second quarter earnings results, investors are piling in on the hope that a COVID-19 vaccine is coming, there will be additional stimulus and corporate profits will bounce back.Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson believes the U.S. is experiencing a V-shaped recovery, noting that the current state of the market resembles other recessionary periods right before economic expansion took place. He argues that given the possibility of a “tremendous” rise in operating leverage post-pandemic, the increased efficiency will translate to higher profits.Taking this outlook into consideration, we set out to find exciting opportunities that won’t break the bank, namely penny stocks. As these tickers trading for less than $5 per share carry risk, due diligence is essential. Using TipRanks’ database, we locked in on three that have garnered glowing reviews from the Street, enough to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Not to mention each offers massive upside potential.Aileron Therapeutics (ALRN)Focused on improving chemotherapy, Aileron Therapeutics wants to help cancer patients fight the disease without the fear or burden of chemotherapy-induced side effects. Based on its recent encouraging data readout and $0.90 share price, this healthcare name has landed right under Wall Street’s microscope.On June 1, ALRN announced positive interim results from the ongoing ALRN-6924 myelopreservation trial in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) being treated with topotecan. The data showed that the candidate was able to alleviate multiple adverse side effects associated with chemotherapy, including anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.It should be noted that the sample size was relatively small. However, one aspect of the results was particularly promising. The therapy reduced the need for blood transfusions in patients treated with the lowest dose. Additionally, the rate of anemia was only 17%.Among the bulls is 5-star analyst John Newman who noted, “If these data are confirmed in a larger trial, we believe ALRN-6924 would be comparable to trilaciclib, with a potential larger market opportunity than G1&amp;#39;s agent.” He added, “We view Aileron&amp;#39;s interim ALRN-6924 myelopreservation results positively, with an established proof-of-concept in reducing topotecan associated hematological toxicities.”This month, ALRN will kick off the schedule optimization part of the study, which will evaluate the therapy at up to two dose levels, potentially with an expansion cohort, in up to 20 SCLC patients. Newman points out that the dosing schedule will be shortened, which could “enhance the chemoprotection effects and offer a more convenient dosing schedule for patients.” He stated, “We look forward to viewing these data in 4Q20 to see how it compares with the 24-hour ALRN-6924 dose schedule.”To this end, Newman rates ALRN a Buy along with a $5 price target, which implies a potential twelve-month gain of 440% from current levels. (To watch Newman’s track record, click here)    Do other analysts agree? They do. Only Buy ratings, 4, in fact, have been issued in the last three months, so the consensus rating is a Strong Buy. At $4, the average price target implies shares could soar 341% in the next year. (See ALRN stock analysis on TipRanks)Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RIGL)Developing cutting-edge small molecule drugs, Rigel hopes its products will ultimately improve the lives of patients with immune and hematologic disorders, cancer and rare diseases. Recently, the company has received attention thanks to the potential of its asset in COVID-19, and with its share price at $2.43, several analysts believe that now is the time to buy.In July, RIGL revealed that fostamatinib (Tavalisse), its SYK inhibitor, will be assessed in patients with ITP caused by COVID-19. Five-star analyst Joseph Pantginis, of H.C. Wainwright, told clients, “Recall that SYK inhibition allows the targeting of both Fc and B-cell receptor signaling pathways, which confers broad potential immunomodulatory properties. Specifically, paths are now being defined for using fostamatinib in acute lung injury (ALI), which is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which contributes to many COVID-19 related deaths.”Tavalisse has already been granted approval in both the U.S. and E.U., so it could “have an easier path for repurposing beyond the treatment of ITP patients (label) in COVID-associated lung injury.” As for what this path looks like, there will be an investigator-sponsored study (IST) at the Imperial College of London to evaluate the drug in COVID-19 pneumonia.The IST will be a two-stage open label, controlled study, with the primary endpoint being the reduction of hospitalized patients progressing from mild-moderate to severe pneumonia. After this study concludes, RIGL may sponsor another study to advance the program.Adding to the good news, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard tested FDA-approved agents’ ability to reduce mucin-1 (MUC-1), which is also a marker in ALI and ARDS, and Tavalisse was the only compound that cut MUC-1. This reflects an additional repurposing opportunity, in Pantginis’ opinion.According to Pantginis, both the IST and MIT/Harvard data showcase the “rapid visibility out of management regarding the potential repurposing of Tavalisse into the COVID-19 fray, which could have positive incremental benefit on the drug&amp;#39;s commercial traction.”If that wasn’t enough, the company announced its partner, Grifols, launched Tavlesse (marketed in the U.S. as Tavalisse) in Germany and the U.K. “As per prior management comments, the progressive expansion to other European countries could be possibly guided by the impact of COVID-19 as different regions are handling the pandemic differently and some are expected to resume clinical activities more quickly than others,” Pantginis said.It’s clear why Pantginis continues to take a bullish stance. To this end, he kept his Buy rating and $8 price target as is. What does this mean for investors? Upside potential of 232% is on the table. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here)  Other analysts are also optimistic about RIGL. A Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 4 Buys and no Holds or Sells. In addition, the $7 average price target brings the upside potential to 190%. (See Rigel stock analysis on TipRanks)Curis Inc. (CRIS)Rounding out our list is Curis, which develops therapies for patients battling cancer. With several potential catalysts on the horizon and a share price of only $1.19, some analysts think investors have a unique opportunity on their hands.Writing for Cantor Fitzgerald, five-star analyst Alethia Young reminds investors that CRIS boasts not one, but two clinical-stage programs, namely CA-4948 (IRAK-4 inhibitor) and CI-8993 (anti-VISTA antibody), which are expected to generate proof-of-concept data in the near-term.Looking at the CA-4948 (IRAK-4 inhibitor) program, a study evaluating the asset in AML and high-risk MDS patients was kicked off after a KOL presentation at ASH suggested IRAK4- L may be the driver mutation in AML/MDS patients. Data is slated for release in Q4 2020.Citing data released in 2019, Young points out that CA-4948 already demonstrated tumor reduction. “Although there were no confirmed responses, we think that the discovery of the oncogenic long-form of IRAK4 in roughly half AML and MDS patients by Amit Verma (presented at ASH’19) could better inform future trials... They are starting this study at 200mg, which seems from the Phase 1 to be the minimally effective dose, suggesting that we could get to efficacy data relatively quickly,” she commented.Additionally, CRIS will study the therapy along with a BTK inhibitor. “Over the next 12 months, we will get updated safety and efficacy data from CA-4948’s NHL trial and learn about the RP2D in Q3, which is very important to inform on the dose used in the Phase 2 BTK combination trial,” Young noted.When it comes to the second program, Young believes it “is interesting optionality to the Curis story.” The company licensed the candidate from ImmuNext in January and its IND was accepted by the FDA, so it can progress to a Phase 1 study. “We think even positive safety findings could be a positive catalyst for the stock as the key question remains whether the company can get to the therapeutic dosing levels safely. We will likely start to get early data in late 2020, but we expect 8993 may become a much bigger focus in 2021 if escalation toward efficacious ranges is successful. We are intrigued by the idea of another potential checkpoint that hasn&amp;#39;t gotten a lot of attention,” she mentioned.All of this prompted Young to state, “At ~$60 million market cap, we think the market gives almost no credit to either program. We think any positive data will drive positive momentum in the shares.”Everything that CRIS has going for it convinced Young to join the bulls. In addition to initiating coverage with an Overweight rating, the analyst set a $4 price target. This target suggests shares could skyrocket 220% in the year ahead. (To watch Young’s track record, click here)  Judging by the consensus breakdown, other analysts also like what they’re seeing. 3 Buys and zero Holds or Sells add up to a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The $5 average price target is more aggressive than Young’s and puts the upside potential at 296%.

Against the backdrop of weak second quarter earnings results, investors are piling in on the hope that a COVID-19 vaccine is coming, there will be additional stimulus and corporate profits will bounce back.Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson believes the U.S. is experiencing a V-shaped recovery, noting that the current state of the market resembles other recessionary periods right before economic expansion took place. He argues that given the possibility of a “tremendous” rise in operating leverage post-pandemic, the increased efficiency will translate to higher profits.Taking this outlook into consideration, we set out to find exciting opportunities that won’t break the bank, namely penny stocks. As these tickers trading for less than $5 per share carry risk, due diligence is essential. Using TipRanks’ database, we locked in on three that have garnered glowing reviews from the Street, enough to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Not to mention each offers massive upside potential.Aileron Therapeutics (ALRN)Focused on improving chemotherapy, Aileron Therapeutics wants to help cancer patients fight the disease without the fear or burden of chemotherapy-induced side effects. Based on its recent encouraging data readout and $0.90 share price, this healthcare name has landed right under Wall Street’s microscope.On June 1, ALRN announced positive interim results from the ongoing ALRN-6924 myelopreservation trial in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) being treated with topotecan. The data showed that the candidate was able to alleviate multiple adverse side effects associated with chemotherapy, including anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.It should be noted that the sample size was relatively small. However, one aspect of the results was particularly promising. The therapy reduced the need for blood transfusions in patients treated with the lowest dose. Additionally, the rate of anemia was only 17%.Among the bulls is 5-star analyst John Newman who noted, “If these data are confirmed in a larger trial, we believe ALRN-6924 would be comparable to trilaciclib, with a potential larger market opportunity than G1&amp;#39;s agent.” He added, “We view Aileron&amp;#39;s interim ALRN-6924 myelopreservation results positively, with an established proof-of-concept in reducing topotecan associated hematological toxicities.”This month, ALRN will kick off the schedule optimization part of the study, which will evaluate the therapy at up to two dose levels, potentially with an expansion cohort, in up to 20 SCLC patients. Newman points out that the dosing schedule will be shortened, which could “enhance the chemoprotection effects and offer a more convenient dosing schedule for patients.” He stated, “We look forward to viewing these data in 4Q20 to see how it compares with the 24-hour ALRN-6924 dose schedule.”To this end, Newman rates ALRN a Buy along with a $5 price target, which implies a potential twelve-month gain of 440% from current levels. (To watch Newman’s track record, click here)    Do other analysts agree? They do. Only Buy ratings, 4, in fact, have been issued in the last three months, so the consensus rating is a Strong Buy. At $4, the average price target implies shares could soar 341% in the next year. (See ALRN stock analysis on TipRanks)Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RIGL)Developing cutting-edge small molecule drugs, Rigel hopes its products will ultimately improve the lives of patients with immune and hematologic disorders, cancer and rare diseases. Recently, the company has received attention thanks to the potential of its asset in COVID-19, and with its share price at $2.43, several analysts believe that now is the time to buy.In July, RIGL revealed that fostamatinib (Tavalisse), its SYK inhibitor, will be assessed in patients with ITP caused by COVID-19. Five-star analyst Joseph Pantginis, of H.C. Wainwright, told clients, “Recall that SYK inhibition allows the targeting of both Fc and B-cell receptor signaling pathways, which confers broad potential immunomodulatory properties. Specifically, paths are now being defined for using fostamatinib in acute lung injury (ALI), which is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which contributes to many COVID-19 related deaths.”Tavalisse has already been granted approval in both the U.S. and E.U., so it could “have an easier path for repurposing beyond the treatment of ITP patients (label) in COVID-associated lung injury.” As for what this path looks like, there will be an investigator-sponsored study (IST) at the Imperial College of London to evaluate the drug in COVID-19 pneumonia.The IST will be a two-stage open label, controlled study, with the primary endpoint being the reduction of hospitalized patients progressing from mild-moderate to severe pneumonia. After this study concludes, RIGL may sponsor another study to advance the program.Adding to the good news, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard tested FDA-approved agents’ ability to reduce mucin-1 (MUC-1), which is also a marker in ALI and ARDS, and Tavalisse was the only compound that cut MUC-1. This reflects an additional repurposing opportunity, in Pantginis’ opinion.According to Pantginis, both the IST and MIT/Harvard data showcase the “rapid visibility out of management regarding the potential repurposing of Tavalisse into the COVID-19 fray, which could have positive incremental benefit on the drug&amp;#39;s commercial traction.”If that wasn’t enough, the company announced its partner, Grifols, launched Tavlesse (marketed in the U.S. as Tavalisse) in Germany and the U.K. “As per prior management comments, the progressive expansion to other European countries could be possibly guided by the impact of COVID-19 as different regions are handling the pandemic differently and some are expected to resume clinical activities more quickly than others,” Pantginis said.It’s clear why Pantginis continues to take a bullish stance. To this end, he kept his Buy rating and $8 price target as is. What does this mean for investors? Upside potential of 232% is on the table. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here)  Other analysts are also optimistic about RIGL. A Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 4 Buys and no Holds or Sells. In addition, the $7 average price target brings the upside potential to 190%. (See Rigel stock analysis on TipRanks)Curis Inc.

Savvy investors know this, and always seek ways to ensure their income stream. Dividends are a common, and popular, way to do this, but bring with them some important questions: Is the dividend reliable – does the company pay it out regularly, in full? Does it yield enough to make the investment worthwhile?These are some of the factors that Wall Street’s analysts weigh when they review dividend stocks. And fortunately, they can answer them in positive terms for investors. While the market conditions aren’t really signaling defensive buying – the S&amp;P 500 has been holding above 3,200 since mid-July, and the NASDAQ has been setting new record highs since June – keeping a reserve of defensive stocks is always a sound strategy to harden your portfolio against the unexpected.With this in mind, we’ve turned to TipRanks database to find three &amp;quot;Strong Buy&amp;quot; dividend stocks with yields starting at 9%, high by any standard, and with potential upsides starting at 14%. These are stocks that will both grow the portfolio and provide a steady income.Hercules Capital (HTGC)We’ll start in venture capital, the engine of so much economic activity. Hercules Capital offers financing services to small, early-stage companies in the technology, life sciences, and financial SaaS sectors, and boasts some $10 billion committed to its investment portfolio.HTGC weathered the corona storm well in the first quarter, reporting strong EPS above the estimates. Q2, however, saw a decline. Investment income fell nearly 2% year-over-year, and EPS dropped to 32 cents, missing the forecast by one cent. Hercules saw a boost from a 5% drop in operating expenses.The quarterly results, while disappointing, were enough to ensure the company’s generous dividend. Hercules has a history of adjusting the payment to keep it line with earnings, but this quarter’s 32 cents per common share was kept stable. The annualized rate, $1.28, gives a yield of nearly 11.1%, which is far better than the 2% average yield found among S&amp;P-listed companies. Hercules has a 13-year history of keeping reliable dividend payments.Tim Hayes, of B. Riley FBR, writes of Hercules, “While lower interest rates weighed on earnings power during the quarter, NII/share covered the $0.32/share quarterly dividend, and we expect the dividend to remain stable in the near-/intermediate term given the healthy cash runway amongst portfolio companies and a strong VC backdrop [...] we remain buyers of shares of HTGC, which currently trade at 1.08x 2Q20 NAV.&amp;quot;In line with these comments, Hayes rates HTGC a Buy along with a $12.50 price target, which implies a 9% upside from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here)Wall Street clearly agrees with Hayes – Hercules has a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 9 analyst reviews. The stock is selling for $11.45 and the average price target of $12.57 is in congruent with Hayes’, suggesting a one-year upside of 10%. (See HTGC stock analysis on TipRanks)Global Net Lease (GNL)Next up, Global Net Lease, is a real estate investment trust. REITs are typically dividend champs, due to tax code provisions requiring them to return a high percentage of earnings directly to investors. GNL, with a portfolio built on US and European commercial properties, aims to provide investors with stable dividends and steady portfolio growth potential. While the growth potential has stalled in recent months, due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis, the company’s stock shares are up 94% since hitting bottom in March. Earnings during 1H20, the ‘corona half,’ have been stable, at 44 cents per share for Q1.In an effort to keep the dividend and EPS in line together, the company cut back the quarterly dividend payment during the half. The current dividend is 40 cents per share, making the yield 9.6%. This is impressive on its own, but more so considering that it comes after a 20% cut and while the stock has been gradually gaining ground.Berenberg analyst Nathan Crossett writes, “The strength of GNL’s portfolio through diversification and focus on investment grade tenancy is exemplified by the level of its rent collections during the peak of the pandemic. As of June 2, GNL had collected 96% of the original cash rent due quarter to date for the second quarter; this includes 99% of rent for assets in the United Kingdom and 97% of rent for assets in the rest of Europe.”A REIT with that level of success in rent collection is easily rated a Buy, and Crossett adds a $22 price target, suggesting room for 34% upside growth. (To watch Crossett’s track record, click here)Overall, Global Net Lease has 3 Buys and 1 Hold behind its Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $16.43 and has an average price target of $20.17, giving it a 23% upside potential. (See GNL stock analysis on TipRanks)Cherry Hill Mortgage (CHMI)Last on today’s list is Cherry Hill Mortgage, named for its headquarters town in New Jersey. This REIT holds a portfolio of mortgage-based assets rather than direct property ownership. CHMI’s portfolio includes heavy investments in mortgage service rights and mortgage-backed securities.Through the first quarter, Cherry Hill beat the forecasts on earnings. Quarterly EPS in both Q4 and Q1 were from Q3 2019, an impressive feat during a period when most companies were seeing sharp drops sequentially. Q1 EPS came in at 47 cents, compared to a 43-cent expectation.In a nod to the ongoing health and financial crises, CHMI cut back on its dividend payment in Q2. The company set the payment at 27 cents per share of common stock, giving an annualized payment of $1.08 and a yield of 11.7%. That dividend yield compares favorably to most other investments, especially US Treasury bonds which are currently at record low rates.5-star analyst Steven DeLaney, of JMP Securities, likes what he sees in CHMI, viewing the company as fundamentally sound. He writes, “in the wake of the March-April market disruption and 1Q20 results … core earnings and book value held up relatively well despite unprecedented COVID-19-related market volatility. We continue to view the company’s valuation as attractive…”DeLaney’s $10.50 price target supports his Buy rating and suggests a solid one-year upside for the stock of 15.5%. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Cherry Hill is another company with a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, this one based on 3 recent reviews. The stock’s average price target of $11.33 is somewhat more bullish than DeLaney allows, indicating room for a 25% upside in the next 12 months.

Savvy investors know this, and always seek ways to ensure their income stream. Dividends are a common, and popular, way to do this, but bring with them some important questions: Is the dividend reliable – does the company pay it out regularly, in full? Does it yield enough to make the investment worthwhile?These are some of the factors that Wall Street’s analysts weigh when they review dividend stocks. And fortunately, they can answer them in positive terms for investors. While the market conditions aren’t really signaling defensive buying – the S&amp;P 500 has been holding above 3,200 since mid-July, and the NASDAQ has been setting new record highs since June – keeping a reserve of defensive stocks is always a sound strategy to harden your portfolio against the unexpected.With this in mind, we’ve turned to TipRanks database to find three &amp;quot;Strong Buy&amp;quot; dividend stocks with yields starting at 9%, high by any standard, and with potential upsides starting at 14%. These are stocks that will both grow the portfolio and provide a steady income.Hercules Capital (HTGC)We’ll start in venture capital, the engine of so much economic activity. Hercules Capital offers financing services to small, early-stage companies in the technology, life sciences, and financial SaaS sectors, and boasts some $10 billion committed to its investment portfolio.HTGC weathered the corona storm well in the first quarter, reporting strong EPS above the estimates. Q2, however, saw a decline. Investment income fell nearly 2% year-over-year, and EPS dropped to 32 cents, missing the forecast by one cent. Hercules saw a boost from a 5% drop in operating expenses.The quarterly results, while disappointing, were enough to ensure the company’s generous dividend. Hercules has a history of adjusting the payment to keep it line with earnings, but this quarter’s 32 cents per common share was kept stable. The annualized rate, $1.28, gives a yield of nearly 11.1%, which is far better than the 2% average yield found among S&amp;P-listed companies. Hercules has a 13-year history of keeping reliable dividend payments.Tim Hayes, of B. Riley FBR, writes of Hercules, “While lower interest rates weighed on earnings power during the quarter, NII/share covered the $0.32/share quarterly dividend, and we expect the dividend to remain stable in the near-/intermediate term given the healthy cash runway amongst portfolio companies and a strong VC backdrop [...] we remain buyers of shares of HTGC, which currently trade at 1.08x 2Q20 NAV.&amp;quot;In line with these comments, Hayes rates HTGC a Buy along with a $12.50 price target, which implies a 9% upside from current levels.

Morgan: These 2 Healthcare Stocks Are Must-Watch Names" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Marching forward together, the previous decade saw equities and bonds rally right alongside each other. At the same time, there was a negative correlation of daily returns, limiting portfolio volatility. This was a good thing for multi-asset portfolios like pension funds which benefited from the high-low frequency correlation, with declining yields also giving a bump to specific equity market sectors.Today, things have changed, with bond yields landing at almost zero. According to J.P. Morgan strategist Marko Kolanovic, this implies that the trend might be fading away, which poses a major threat to multi-asset portfolios.“Should yields (or inflation expectations) start rising, these portfolios could experience a triple-whammy: bond values would go lower, valuations of the above-described equity market segments would be under pressure, and bond-equity correlation would deteriorate as it is itself correlated with yields,” Kolanovic explained. The strategist added that even if yields don’t rise, in the long run, it’s unlikely that such portfolios will see mid-to-high single-digit returns.So, what does Kolanovic think investors should do? He suggests buying stocks with a more negative correlation to bonds, pointing to value and cyclical names in particular.Offering up concrete recommendations based on Kolanovic’s strategy, the analysts at J.P. Morgan are pounding the table on two stocks, noting that each could climb at least 60% higher in the year ahead. Using TipRanks’ database, we found out that each ticker has also received Buy ratings from the rest of the Street.Autolus Therapeutics (AUTL)Primarily focused on the development of precisely targeted, controlled and highly active T cell therapies, Autolus Therapeutics wants to offer cancer patients treatment options that are superior to the existing standard of care. Given its innovative technology, it’s clear why J.P. Morgan has been impressed by this healthcare name.Writing for the firm, four-star analyst Eric Joseph calls its lead programs, AUTO1 and AUTO3, “potentially best-in-class autologous CAR-T candidate therapies for the treatment of ALL and DLBCL.” When it comes to AUTO1, the available Phase 1/2 data provides a “meaningful de-risking,” with it having the potential to be the first auto-CAR-T therapy approved for both adult and pediatric ALL.Expounding on this, Joseph stated, “Combined, we forecast a worldwide peak sales opportunity of ~$275 million and anticipate U.S. approval for AUTO1 in 2023. Further, as the company is also exploring adoption potential in the outpatient/community oncology setting, we see the safety profile demonstrated to date.”As for AUTO3, its dual CD19/CD22-targeting CAR design makes it a stand-out, in Joseph’s opinion, as it could “yield more durable remissions relative to the currently approved CAR-T class.” In addition, the fact that the asset is more easily tolerated means it could be adopted in an outpatient setting, potentially expanding the addressable DLBCL commercial opportunity. Pivotal development is slated to kick off in 1H21, with regulatory approval potentially coming in 2024. The analyst estimates a worldwide peak sales opportunity of $1.5 billion.To this end, Joseph tells clients to watch out for several possible catalysts in 2H20 including full Phase 1 data for the ALEXANDER study of AUTO3 in DLBCL, long-term follow-up data from the Phase 1 ALLCAR19 study of AUTO1 in adult ALL as well as the initiation of Phase 1 development for AUTO1NG (pediatric ALL), AUTO3NG (DLBCL) and AUTO8 (multiple myeloma).Based on these key catalysts, Joseph commented, “...we believe current AUTL levels undervalue the risk-adjusted commercial potential of these two lead programs in addition to the broader pipeline of CAR-T candidates for heme onc and solid tumor indications.”All of the above convinced Joseph to step over to the bulls’ side. In addition to initiating coverage with an Overweight rating, the analyst set a $25 price target. This target suggests shares could rise 67.5% in the year ahead. (To watch Joseph’s track record, click here)   The bulls represent the majority on this one. Out of 8 total reviews published in the last three months, 7 analysts rated the stock a Buy, while only 1 said Hold. So, the word on the Street is that AUTL is a Strong Buy. The $25.29 average price target lands just above Joseph’s and puts the upside potential at 73%. (See AUTL stock analysis on TipRanks)Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN)Targeting rare and devastating diseases, Alexion Pharmaceuticals hopes its therapies will be able to address the unmet medical needs of patients from all over the world. On the heels of its strong Q2 showing, J.P. Morgan thinks that now is the time to pull the trigger.Thanks to continued solid commercial execution across its key franchises, five-star analyst Cory Kasimov tells investors that ALXN was able to deliver double-digit top and bottom-line beats. As a result, management boosted its 2020 guidance for the top and bottom-lines. This is set to be driven by the lower than expected impact to new patient starts in 1H, strong compliance rates across indications, continued conversion to Ultomiris (aHUS in particular) and payer impact that hasn’t been observed yet.Although the new patient queue is slowing and COVID-19 poses a risk to compliance rates, which could have a negative impact on the top-line and operating margins, management announced a commitment to $500-$550 million of repurchases in 2020, increasing to at least one third of free cash flow, on average, from 2021-2023.Looking at its pipeline, it should be noted that ALXN discontinued ALXN-2040 (danicopan) in C3G, much to the dismay of some investors. That being said, plans for the Phase 3 study in PNH are on track.As a reminder, its Soliris therapy got the stamp of approval in 2007 and up until the approval of ALXN’s follow-on product, Ultomiris, in December 2018, it was the only available therapy for the treatment of PNH. Even though Ultomiris wasn’t able to generate superior results over Soliris in Phase 3 studies, its less frequent dosing schedule has enabled the rapid conversion, in Kasimov’s opinion.“We see the rapid conversion of Ultomiris in PNH translating to the aHUS indication, as well continued uptake of Soliris in neurology, which sets up the C5 franchise for a sustainable growth trajectory further supporting the attractive risk/reward profile at the current valuation,” Kasimov said.Based on everything ALXN has going for it, Kasimov reiterated an Overweight rating. He also bumped up the price target from $158 to $167, suggesting 59% upside potential. (To watch Kasimov’s track record, click here)  Turning now to the rest of the Street, 10 Buys and 5 Holds have been assigned in the last three months, which add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. In addition, the $146.67 average price target brings the upside potential to 41%.

Morgan: These 2 Healthcare Stocks Are Must-Watch Names" align="left" title="J.P. Morgan: These 2 Healthcare Stocks Are Must-Watch Names" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Marching forward together, the previous decade saw equities and bonds rally right alongside each other. At the same time, there was a negative correlation of daily returns, limiting portfolio volatility. This was a good thing for multi-asset portfolios like pension funds which benefited from the high-low frequency correlation, with declining yields also giving a bump to specific equity market sectors.Today, things have changed, with bond yields landing at almost zero. According to J.P. Morgan strategist Marko Kolanovic, this implies that the trend might be fading away, which poses a major threat to multi-asset portfolios.“Should yields (or inflation expectations) start rising, these portfolios could experience a triple-whammy: bond values would go lower, valuations of the above-described equity market segments would be under pressure, and bond-equity correlation would deteriorate as it is itself correlated with yields,” Kolanovic explained. The strategist added that even if yields don’t rise, in the long run, it’s unlikely that such portfolios will see mid-to-high single-digit returns.So, what does Kolanovic think investors should do? He suggests buying stocks with a more negative correlation to bonds, pointing to value and cyclical names in particular.Offering up concrete recommendations based on Kolanovic’s strategy, the analysts at J.P. Morgan are pounding the table on two stocks, noting that each could climb at least 60% higher in the year ahead. Using TipRanks’ database, we found out that each ticker has also received Buy ratings from the rest of the Street.Autolus Therapeutics (AUTL)Primarily focused on the development of precisely targeted, controlled and highly active T cell therapies, Autolus Therapeutics wants to offer cancer patients treatment options that are superior to the existing standard of care.

Gold could extend gains as governments and central banks respond to slowing growth with vast amounts of stimulus. The metal’s appeal is strengthening as the dollar weakens and a long global recovery looms.

Faced with rising competition for advertisers from ByteDance Ltd. and its rapidly growing stable of apps, the WeChat operator would then run a highly profitable service akin to Amazon.com Inc.’s Twitch. Huya and DouYu would keep their respective platforms and branding while working more closely with Tencent’s own esports site eGame, said the people.Douyu’s shares surged 18% in pre-market trade in New York, while Huya soared 15%. Tencent climbed 2% to a two-week high in Hong Kong.“As the major shareholder of both platforms, Tencent would benefit because a merger would remove unnecessary competition between them,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “The enlarged scale can also help to drive cost synergies and fend off emerging competitors.”Tencent and DouYu representatives declined to comment, while Huya spokespeople didn’t respond to requests for comment.Tencent’s shoring up its home-market position against the backdrop of a Trump administration increasingly hostile toward Chinese tech companies.

He kicked off a round of mergers that saw his company and four others dominate the industry -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. in the U.S., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SE in Europe.That era ended on Tuesday when Bernard Looney, the third chief executive officer since Browne’s swashbuckling reign ended in 2007, declared BP would be a supermajor no more and proposed a very different blueprint for the oil company of the future.Just six months after taking the helm, Looney has put meat on the bones of his plans to make BP compliant with the Paris accord on climate change, saying he’ll cut dividends in half, shrink oil and gas output by 40% over the next decade and spend as much as $5 billion a year building one of the world’s largest renewable-power businesses.Where Browne created a global model, Looney’s strategy shows the oil industry is splitting in two.On one side of the Atlantic, BP, Shell and Total are trying to make themselves going concerns for a low-carbon age, diluting their fossil-fuel businesses with plans to build significant revenues from renewable energy. Exxon and Chevron -- insulated from the pressure applied by European investors and politicians -- are charting a different course: keep pumping as profitably as possible and hand the cash back to investors. Like Big Tobacco, they’re increasingly courting shareholders willing to put returns above the harm their product causes.Pay Out or Diversify“BP had two choices,” said Brian Scott-Quinn, emeritus professor at Henley Business School in southern England, who’s written on financial markets and climate change. “First, simply paying out the maximum dividend it can in the future by not investing in the future at all. Alternatively, it can diversify on a much larger scale.”Looney described his seismic shift as making an integrated oil company into an integrated energy company.“You have to knit together lots of different energy sources,” Looney said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday. “We are natural gas, we’re in solar, we’re in wind, we have one of the world’s largest trading organizations.”It’s a complete change of direction for a company that raised the dividend earlier this year and has been hammered by the post-pandemic crash in oil prices. And there are plenty of risks ahead.BP concedes that power projects still make lower returns than oil and gas investments -- one reason why the board agreed to a lower dividend. And management has acknowledged that hydrocarbon production will probably remain BP’s main source of earnings for “the next several years,” funding its shift toward cleaner energy.It’s also unclear what competitive advantage an oil company brings to building wind farms and solar parks; traditional power utilities have had a long head-start.But there are dangers for Exxon and Chevron too. As alarm over global warming increases, their universe of potential investors may keep shrinking, especially if Joe Biden takes the White House in November and resets U.S. energy policy. As this quarter’s record losses show, if the post-Covid slump in crude prices is sustained, generating meaningful returns from oil and gas won’t be easy. A decade ago, Exxon was the most valuable U.S. corporation. Today it ranks 41st.See also: Tesla Overtakes Exxon’s Market Value in Symbolic Energy Shift“There’s definitely a division between the Europeans, who are much more committed to meeting the climate agenda,” and the Americans, said Panmure Gordon &amp; Co. analyst Colin Smith. Their success will depend on how attractive the pivot in investments is perceived to be, relative to continued spending on oil and gas, he said.Unlike their European peers, Exxon and Chevron have managed to bat away investor pressure thus far. Both companies, backed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have resisted requests for shareholders to vote on their emission strategies.But they’ve been struggling with meager returns after investing heavily in megaprojects around the world for a decade, leaving them wholly unprepared for the era of cheap oil that began in 2014. Slow to realize the transformational effect of the shale revolution that happened on their doorstep, Exxon and Chevron are only now understanding that they must become more nimble to respond to market conditions, rather than dictate them.Sticking With OilUnder their current CEOs, neither U.S. major has the will to follow the Europeans down the green path. Both plan to stick with oil and gas long-term, tempered only by small clean-energy technology bets. For them, rushing to renewables -- where they have no competitive advantage and see smaller returns in a more regulated industry -- is not the answer.Yet in Europe, BP’s newly fleshed out plans will no doubt add pressure on Shell, which also announced ambitions earlier this year to slash its carbon emissions by 2050 and increasingly turn to renewables. The Anglo-Dutch major has promised more detail on that shift, which will ultimately result in it only doing business with emission-free companies.For the European majors, the success of their strategy depends in part on governments maintaining the scale of policy support needed to make the energy transition happen. With countries around the world pledging greener economies as they emerge from the devastation of the coronavirus, BP may have chosen its moment wisely.“If ever there was a moment to reset, this was it,” said Luke Parker, vice president of corporate analysis at consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Several factors have converged to make it possible: coronavirus and everything that comes with it; a strategic pivot to net-zero on the horizon” and a “new leadership with credit in the bank.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-walks-away-oil-supermajor-080220211.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2020 04:02:20 -0400</pubDate><source url="https://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</source><guid isPermaLink="false">bp-walks-away-oil-supermajor-080220211.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iTgiLJoLx9SF80kjWocBTg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/24cc5d81360dad7f37ba41c15e1cd51d" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-walks-away-oil-supermajor-080220211.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iTgiLJoLx9SF80kjWocBTg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/24cc5d81360dad7f37ba41c15e1cd51d" width="130" height="86" alt="BP Walks Away From the Oil Supermajor Model It Helped Create" align="left" title="BP Walks Away From the Oil Supermajor Model It Helped Create" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Bloomberg) -- In the late 1990s, BP Plc boss John Browne used an oil-price slump to usher in the age of the supermajor, buying U.S. rivals Amoco and Arco to create a transatlantic giant.

Their success will depend on how attractive the pivot in investments is perceived to be, relative to continued spending on oil and gas, he said.Unlike their European peers, Exxon and Chevron have managed to bat away investor pressure thus far. Both companies, backed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have resisted requests for shareholders to vote on their emission strategies.But they’ve been struggling with meager returns after investing heavily in megaprojects around the world for a decade, leaving them wholly unprepared for the era of cheap oil that began in 2014. Slow to realize the transformational effect of the shale revolution that happened on their doorstep, Exxon and Chevron are only now understanding that they must become more nimble to respond to market conditions, rather than dictate them.Sticking With OilUnder their current CEOs, neither U.S. major has the will to follow the Europeans down the green path. Both plan to stick with oil and gas long-term, tempered only by small clean-energy technology bets. For them, rushing to renewables -- where they have no competitive advantage and see smaller returns in a more regulated industry -- is not the answer.Yet in Europe, BP’s newly fleshed out plans will no doubt add pressure on Shell, which also announced ambitions earlier this year to slash its carbon emissions by 2050 and increasingly turn to renewables. The Anglo-Dutch major has promised more detail on that shift, which will ultimately result in it only doing business with emission-free companies.For the European majors, the success of their strategy depends in part on governments maintaining the scale of policy support needed to make the energy transition happen. With countries around the world pledging greener economies as they emerge from the devastation of the coronavirus, BP may have chosen its moment wisely.“If ever there was a moment to reset, this was it,” said Luke Parker, vice president of corporate analysis at consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Several factors have converged to make it possible: coronavirus and everything that comes with it; a strategic pivot to net-zero on the horizon” and a “new leadership with credit in the bank.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"/></item><item><title>Why Philip Morris (PM) Stock is a Compelling Investment Case</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-philip-morris-pm-stock-142536116.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KD8lPMvOf6ZsP.UTYGckRg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/insidermonkey.com/01ba5eddceb9c8da76aa5c030330e1c3" width="130" height="86" alt="Why Philip Morris (PM) Stock is a Compelling Investment Case" align="left" title="Why Philip Morris (PM) Stock is a Compelling Investment Case" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;First Eagle Investment Management recently released its Q2 2020 Investor Letter, a copy of which you can download here.

While August has often been a month of turmoil, with thin trading and other seasonal factors boosting volatility, the slide in yields -- particularly those on inflation-adjusted debt -- could cause renewed turmoil.“Historically when real yields reach a new bottom, it is followed by a higher MOVE,” said Ben Emons, head of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors, referring to the ICE BofA MOVE Index that tracks Treasury swings.

While that has provided much-needed liquidity to struggling businesses, the rally has been so broad-based that it has also allowed less-impacted companies to sell debt to fund payouts to shareholders.Read more: Airlines pledge aircraft, loyalty programs in bid to tap fundingWestern Global is looking to raise $410 million through its first ever junk bond offering as part of a plan to sell a minority stake to employees. The deal will see founder Jim Neff and other existing shareholders sell as much as 49% of the company to the employee stock ownership plan.“We believe that our employees are the best strategic partners and view the ESOP as a win-win for both the employees and the company,” a representative said in response to requests for comment. As essential transportation, the airline also experienced substantially higher operating costs in the Covid-19 environment, the company representative said.Tax BenefitsUnder the plan, the airline will lend proceeds from the bond offering to a newly set-up ESOP, which will use the funds to purchase the stake. The plan will use annual contributions it receives from the company to repay the debt over time.Western Global expects to realize significant tax benefits from the arrangement as it will be able to deduct interest on the debt and contributions made to the plan, according to people with knowledge of the company’s presentation to investors. The deal is also expected to dissuade workers from unionizing, preserving one of Western Global’s key advantages versus competitors, the people said, asking not to be named when discussing confidential information.The company began sounding out potential investors for the five-year bonds last week at a yield in the 8.25% to 8.5% range, some of the people said. In a sign of tepid demand from potential investors, the range was revised on Tuesday to 8.75% to 9%. Western Global also shifted $10 million to a separate revolver, reducing the offering’s original $420 million size.A representative for Royal Bank of Canada, which is leading the bond sale, declined to comment.Demand SurgeWhile Western Global and other cargo carriers are enjoying an increase in demand, passenger airlines have had to borrow billions of dollars and sell stock, diluting existing holders, to shore up their cash reserves as the pandemic wreaks havoc across the travel industry.Analysts at S&amp;P Global Ratings said in late July that they expect Western Global’s revenue to jump by more than 90% this year thanks to higher demand for cargo shipments and less capacity from passenger airlines during the pandemic.UPS is Western Global’s largest customer, accounting for around 24% of revenue in the first six months of the year, the airline said in documents shared with potential investors. Amazon, which only became a customer this year, and the U.S. Department of Defense, which approved the company as a contractor in 2016, made up around 16% and 14% respectively, the documents show.The airline transports cargo for Amazon from Hong Kong to Los Angeles three times a week, and recently agreed an extension of the service through the year end, according to the documents shared with investors.

While that has provided much-needed liquidity to struggling businesses, the rally has been so broad-based that it has also allowed less-impacted companies to sell debt to fund payouts to shareholders.Read more: Airlines pledge aircraft, loyalty programs in bid to tap fundingWestern Global is looking to raise $410 million through its first ever junk bond offering as part of a plan to sell a minority stake to employees. The deal will see founder Jim Neff and other existing shareholders sell as much as 49% of the company to the employee stock ownership plan.“We believe that our employees are the best strategic partners and view the ESOP as a win-win for both the employees and the company,” a representative said in response to requests for comment. As essential transportation, the airline also experienced substantially higher operating costs in the Covid-19 environment, the company representative said.Tax BenefitsUnder the plan, the airline will lend proceeds from the bond offering to a newly set-up ESOP, which will use the funds to purchase the stake. The plan will use annual contributions it receives from the company to repay the debt over time.Western Global expects to realize significant tax benefits from the arrangement as it will be able to deduct interest on the debt and contributions made to the plan, according to people with knowledge of the company’s presentation to investors. The deal is also expected to dissuade workers from unionizing, preserving one of Western Global’s key advantages versus competitors, the people said, asking not to be named when discussing confidential information.The company began sounding out potential investors for the five-year bonds last week at a yield in the 8.25% to 8.5% range, some of the people said. In a sign of tepid demand from potential investors, the range was revised on Tuesday to 8.75% to 9%. Western Global also shifted $10 million to a separate revolver, reducing the offering’s original $420 million size.A representative for Royal Bank of Canada, which is leading the bond sale, declined to comment.Demand SurgeWhile Western Global and other cargo carriers are enjoying an increase in demand, passenger airlines have had to borrow billions of dollars and sell stock, diluting existing holders, to shore up their cash reserves as the pandemic wreaks havoc across the travel industry.Analysts at S&amp;P Global Ratings said in late July that they expect Western Global’s revenue to jump by more than 90% this year thanks to higher demand for cargo shipments and less capacity from passenger airlines during the pandemic.UPS is Western Global’s largest customer, accounting for around 24% of revenue in the first six months of the year, the airline said in documents shared with potential investors. Amazon, which only became a customer this year, and the U.S. Department of Defense, which approved the company as a contractor in 2016, made up around 16% and 14% respectively, the documents show.The airline transports cargo for Amazon from Hong Kong to Los Angeles three times a week, and recently agreed an extension of the service through the year end, according to the documents shared with investors.
