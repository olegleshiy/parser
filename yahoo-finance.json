Savvy investors know this, and always seek ways to ensure their income stream. Dividends are common, and popular, way to do this, but bring with them some important questions: Is the dividend reliable – does the company pay it out regularly, in full? Does it yield enough to make the investment worthwhile?These are some of the factors that Wall Street’s analysts weigh when they review dividend stocks. And fortunately, they can answer them in positive terms for investors. For while the market conditions aren’t really signaling defensive buying – the S&P 500 has been holding above 3,200 since mid-July, and the NASDAQ has been setting new record highs since June – keeping a reserve of defensive stocks is always a sound strategy to harden your portfolio against the unexpected.With this in mind, we’ve turned to TipRanks database to find three &quot;Strong Buy&quot; dividend stocks with yields starting at 9%, high by any standard, and with potential upsides starting at 14%. These are stocks that will both grow the portfolio and provide a steady income.Hercules Capital (HTGC)We’ll start in venture capital, the engine of so much economic activity. Hercules Capital offers financing services to small, early-stage companies in the technology, life sciences, and financial SaaS sectors, and boasts some $10 billion committed to its investment portfolio.HTGC weathered the corona storm well in the first quarter, reporting strong EPS above the estimates. Q2, however, saw a decline. Investment income fell nearly 2% year-over-year, and EPS dropped to 32 cents, missing the forecast by one cent. Hercules saw a boost from a 5% drop in operating expenses.The quarterly results, while disappointing, were enough to ensure the company’s generous dividend. Hercules has a history of adjusting the payment to keep it line with earnings, but this quarter’s 32 cents per common share was kept stable. The annualized rate, $1.28, gives a yield of nearly 11.1%, which is far better than the 2% average yield found among S&P-listed companies. Hercules has a 13-year history of keeping reliable dividend payments.Tim Hayes, of B. Riley FBR, writes of Hercules, “While lower interest rates weighed on earnings power during the quarter, NII/share covered the $0.32/share quarterly dividend, and we expect the dividend to remain stable in the near-/intermediate term given the healthy cash runway amongst portfolio companies and a strong VC backdrop [...] we remain buyers of shares of HTGC, which currently trade at 1.08x 2Q20 NAV.&quot;In line with these comments, Hayes rates HTGC a Buy along with a $12.50 price target, which implies a 9% upside from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here)Wall Street clearly agrees with Hayes – Hercules has a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 9 analyst reviews. The stock is selling for $11.45 and the average price target of $12.57 is in congruent with Hayes’, suggesting a one-year upside of 10%. (See HTGC stock analysis on TipRanks)Global Net Lease (GNL)Next up, Global Net Lease, is a real estate investment trust. REITs are typically dividend champs, due to tax code provisions requiring them to return a high percentage of earnings directly to investors. GNL, with a portfolio built on US and European commercial properties, aims to provide investors with stable dividends and steady portfolio growth potential. While the growth potential has stalled in recent months, due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis, the company’s stock shares are up 94% since hitting bottom in March. Earnings during 1H20, the ‘corona half,’ have been stable, at 44 cents per share for Q1.In an effort to keep the dividend and EPS in line together, the company cut back the quarterly dividend payment during the half. The current dividend is 40 cents per share, making the yield 9.6%. This is impressive on its own, but more so considering that it comes after a 20% cut and while the stock has been gradually gaining ground.Berenberg analyst Nathan Crossett writes, “The strength of GNL’s portfolio through diversification and focus on investment grade tenancy is exemplified by the level of its rent collections during the peak of the pandemic. As of June 2, GNL had collected 96% of the original cash rent due quarter to date for the second quarter; this includes 99% of rent for assets in the United Kingdom and 97% of rent for assets in the rest of Europe.”A REIT with that level of success in rent collection is easily rated a Buy, and Crossett adds a $22 price target, suggesting room for 34% upside growth. (To watch Crossett’s track record, click here)Overall, Global Net Lease has 3 Buys and 1 Hold behind its Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $16.43 and has an average price target of $20.17, giving it a 23% upside potential. (See GNL stock analysis on TipRanks)Cherry Hill Mortgage (CHMI)Last on today’s list is Cherry Hill Mortgage, named for its headquarters town in New Jersey. This REIT holds a portfolio of mortgage-based assets rather than direct property ownership. CHMI’s portfolio includes heavy investments in mortgage service rights and mortgage-backed securities.Through the first quarter, Cherry Hill beat the forecasts on earnings. Quarterly EPS in both Q4 and Q1 were from Q3 2019, an impressive feat during a period when most companies were seeing sharp drops sequentially. Q1 EPS came in at 47 cents, compared to a 43-cent expectation.In a nod to the ongoing health and financial crises, CHMI cut back on its dividend payment in Q2. The company set the payment at 27 cents per share of common stock, giving an annualized payment of $1.08 and a yield of 11.7%. That dividend yield compares favorably to most other investments, especially US Treasury bonds which are currently at record low rates.5-star analyst Steven DeLaney, of JMP Securities, likes what he sees in CHMI, viewing the company as fundamentally sound. He writes, “in the wake of the March-April market disruption and 1Q20 results … core earnings and book value held up relatively well despite unprecedented COVID-19-related market volatility. We continue to view the company’s valuation as attractive…”DeLaney’s $10.50 price target supports his Buy rating and suggests a solid one-year upside for the stock of 15.5%. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Cherry Hill is another company with a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, this one based on 3 recent reviews. The stock’s average price target of $11.33 is somewhat more bullish than DeLaney allows, indicating room for a 25% upside in the next 12 months.

Against the backdrop of weak second quarter earnings results, investors are piling in on the hope that a COVID-19 vaccine is coming, there will be additional stimulus and corporate profits will bounce back.Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson believes the U.S. is experiencing a V-shaped recovery, noting that the current state of the market resembles other recessionary periods right before economic expansion took place. He argues that given the possibility of a “tremendous” rise in operating leverage post-pandemic, the increased efficiency will translate to higher profits.Taking this outlook into consideration, we set out to find exciting opportunities that won’t break the bank, namely penny stocks. As these tickers trading for less than $5 per share carry risk, due diligence is essential. Using TipRanks’ database, we locked in on three that have garnered glowing reviews from the Street, enough to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Not to mention each offers massive upside potential.Aileron Therapeutics (ALRN)Focused on improving chemotherapy, Aileron Therapeutics wants to help cancer patients fight the disease without the fear or burden of chemotherapy-induced side effects. Based on its recent encouraging data readout and $0.90 share price, this healthcare name has landed right under Wall Street’s microscope.On June 1, ALRN announced positive interim results from the ongoing ALRN-6924 myelopreservation trial in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) being treated with topotecan. The data showed that the candidate was able to alleviate multiple adverse side effects associated with chemotherapy, including anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.It should be noted that the sample size was relatively small. However, one aspect of the results was particularly promising. The therapy reduced the need for blood transfusions in patients treated with the lowest dose. Additionally, the rate of anemia was only 17%.Among the bulls is 5-star analyst John Newman who noted, “If these data are confirmed in a larger trial, we believe ALRN-6924 would be comparable to trilaciclib, with a potential larger market opportunity than G1&#39;s agent.” He added, “We view Aileron&#39;s interim ALRN-6924 myelopreservation results positively, with an established proof-of-concept in reducing topotecan associated hematological toxicities.”This month, ALRN will kick off the schedule optimization part of the study, which will evaluate the therapy at up to two dose levels, potentially with an expansion cohort, in up to 20 SCLC patients. Newman points out that the dosing schedule will be shortened, which could “enhance the chemoprotection effects and offer a more convenient dosing schedule for patients.” He stated, “We look forward to viewing these data in 4Q20 to see how it compares with the 24-hour ALRN-6924 dose schedule.”To this end, Newman rates ALRN a Buy along with a $5 price target, which implies a potential twelve-month gain of 440% from current levels. (To watch Newman’s track record, click here)    Do other analysts agree? They do. Only Buy ratings, 4, in fact, have been issued in the last three months, so the consensus rating is a Strong Buy. At $4, the average price target implies shares could soar 341% in the next year. (See ALRN stock analysis on TipRanks)Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RIGL)Developing cutting-edge small molecule drugs, Rigel hopes its products will ultimately improve the lives of patients with immune and hematologic disorders, cancer and rare diseases. Recently, the company has received attention thanks to the potential of its asset in COVID-19, and with its share price at $2.43, several analysts believe that now is the time to buy.In July, RIGL revealed that fostamatinib (Tavalisse), its SYK inhibitor, will be assessed in patients with ITP caused by COVID-19. Five-star analyst Joseph Pantginis, of H.C. Wainwright, told clients, “Recall that SYK inhibition allows the targeting of both Fc and B-cell receptor signaling pathways, which confers broad potential immunomodulatory properties. Specifically, paths are now being defined for using fostamatinib in acute lung injury (ALI), which is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which contributes to many COVID-19 related deaths.”Tavalisse has already been granted approval in both the U.S. and E.U., so it could “have an easier path for repurposing beyond the treatment of ITP patients (label) in COVID-associated lung injury.” As for what this path looks like, there will be an investigator-sponsored study (IST) at the Imperial College of London to evaluate the drug in COVID-19 pneumonia.The IST will be a two-stage open label, controlled study, with the primary endpoint being the reduction of hospitalized patients progressing from mild-moderate to severe pneumonia. After this study concludes, RIGL may sponsor another study to advance the program.Adding to the good news, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard tested FDA-approved agents’ ability to reduce mucin-1 (MUC-1), which is also a marker in ALI and ARDS, and Tavalisse was the only compound that cut MUC-1. This reflects an additional repurposing opportunity, in Pantginis’ opinion.According to Pantginis, both the IST and MIT/Harvard data showcase the “rapid visibility out of management regarding the potential repurposing of Tavalisse into the COVID-19 fray, which could have positive incremental benefit on the drug&#39;s commercial traction.”If that wasn’t enough, the company announced its partner, Grifols, launched Tavlesse (marketed in the U.S. as Tavalisse) in Germany and the U.K. “As per prior management comments, the progressive expansion to other European countries could be possibly guided by the impact of COVID-19 as different regions are handling the pandemic differently and some are expected to resume clinical activities more quickly than others,” Pantginis said.It’s clear why Pantginis continues to take a bullish stance. To this end, he kept his Buy rating and $8 price target as is. What does this mean for investors? Upside potential of 232% is on the table. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here)  Other analysts are also optimistic about RIGL. A Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 4 Buys and no Holds or Sells. In addition, the $7 average price target brings the upside potential to 190%. (See Rigel stock analysis on TipRanks)Curis Inc. (CRIS)Rounding out our list is Curis, which develops therapies for patients battling cancer. With several potential catalysts on the horizon and a share price of only $1.19, some analysts think investors have a unique opportunity on their hands.Writing for Cantor Fitzgerald, five-star analyst Alethia Young reminds investors that CRIS boasts not one, but two clinical-stage programs, namely CA-4948 (IRAK-4 inhibitor) and CI-8993 (anti-VISTA antibody), which are expected to generate proof-of-concept data in the near-term.Looking at the CA-4948 (IRAK-4 inhibitor) program, a study evaluating the asset in AML and high-risk MDS patients was kicked off after a KOL presentation at ASH suggested IRAK4- L may be the driver mutation in AML/MDS patients. Data is slated for release in Q4 2020.Citing data released in 2019, Young points out that CA-4948 already demonstrated tumor reduction. “Although there were no confirmed responses, we think that the discovery of the oncogenic long-form of IRAK4 in roughly half AML and MDS patients by Amit Verma (presented at ASH’19) could better inform future trials... They are starting this study at 200mg, which seems from the Phase 1 to be the minimally effective dose, suggesting that we could get to efficacy data relatively quickly,” she commented.Additionally, CRIS will study the therapy along with a BTK inhibitor. “Over the next 12 months, we will get updated safety and efficacy data from CA-4948’s NHL trial and learn about the RP2D in Q3, which is very important to inform on the dose used in the Phase 2 BTK combination trial,” Young noted.When it comes to the second program, Young believes it “is interesting optionality to the Curis story.” The company licensed the candidate from ImmuNext in January and its IND was accepted by the FDA, so it can progress to a Phase 1 study. “We think even positive safety findings could be a positive catalyst for the stock as the key question remains whether the company can get to the therapeutic dosing levels safely. We will likely start to get early data in late 2020, but we expect 8993 may become a much bigger focus in 2021 if escalation toward efficacious ranges is successful. We are intrigued by the idea of another potential checkpoint that hasn&#39;t gotten a lot of attention,” she mentioned.All of this prompted Young to state, “At ~$60 million market cap, we think the market gives almost no credit to either program. We think any positive data will drive positive momentum in the shares.”Everything that CRIS has going for it convinced Young to join the bulls. In addition to initiating coverage with an Overweight rating, the analyst set a $4 price target. This target suggests shares could skyrocket 220% in the year ahead. (To watch Young’s track record, click here)  Judging by the consensus breakdown, other analysts also like what they’re seeing. 3 Buys and zero Holds or Sells add up to a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The $5 average price target is more aggressive than Young’s and puts the upside potential at 296%.

Sure, there have been plenty of good weeks so far in 2020 – shares are up by a resounding 190% year-to-date. And according to H.C. Wainwright analyst Ram Selvaraju, there’s plenty more to come.Selvaraju reiterated a Buy rating on SRNE shares and boosted his price target to $30. If the market plays nice with Selvaraju’s forecast, investors could be adding a massive 207% to their portfolios over the next 12 months. (To watch Selvaraju’s track record, click here)That’s an extremely bullish call, so what lies behind it? Last week, Sorrento announced it had inked a licensing deal with Columbia University for an innovative new COVID-19 test. The university has given Sorrento the rights to a fast, one-step diagnostic test that samples saliva and can detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 30 minutes.COVI-TRACE – the test’s name – will be marketed by Sorrento. What sets it apart from other diagnostic products is that all testing materials are held in a single tube, eliminating the need for any laboratory equipment. The advantages are obvious, as this means the test is mobile and can be used in various settings - either on site, for point-of-care or even for home testing.With the number of COVID-19 cases spiking, laboratories across the country are finding it difficult to meet the demand. As a result of the current backlog, average turnaround times for test results are reportedly between several days to over a week. Selvaraju expects Sorrento to file for EUA certification immediately.  The 5-star analyst said, “We believe that the incentive to facilitate the large-scale and indeed ubiquitous deployment of the COVI-TRACE test is extremely high and governments worldwide may seek to implement this in their respective regions. Our current assumptions viewed in this context may be considered conservative—we utilize a $15 price per test (payable on a cash basis, which obviates the reimbursement part of the equation) and anticipate that roughly 56.5 million such tests could be conducted at peak annually, resulting in total sales of roughly $1 billion.&quot;Overall, only one other analyst has thrown the hat in with a review of the high-flying biotech over the past three months. The extra Buy provides Sorrento with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $27, the average price target implies upside potential of 181%.

His daughter, Abigail “Abby” Pierrepont Johnson, now chief executive officer of the family business, is among the most influential people in money management.Yet for a firm that encouraged a cult of personality around its star fund managers, its biggest shareholders and the family’s intricate web of investments remain very much a mystery. Their empire extends from the Boston Seaport to London, Tokyo and West Texas in businesses ranging from hospitals to fiber-optic communication.They are arguably Boston&#39;s most powerful family and certainly the richest. But they — and their business interests — remain intensely private.  The scant personal details that do surface depict a clan allergic to the limelight, scornful of excess and almost comically unpretentious. This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen people, including friends and business partners, most of whom asked not to be identified because of the family’s aversion to publicity.For a while, Abby was said to drive a pickup truck. At her local gym in downtown Boston, she was one of the few women who chose to wear the stodgy gym-issued uniform. She flies commercial and rarely dines out.“Abby is always so understated,” said New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, a friend of Abby and her husband, Christopher McKown. Kraft said he tried to meet with the Johnsons for a meal every few months when Ned was more active in the business. “I’ve always enjoyed their company and found them to be down-to-Earth and just great people. It’s a real credit to the family that they come across that way.”Read more: World’s wealthiest family gets $1 billion richer every two weeksAbby’s social circle, which also includes Boston Red Sox owner John Henry, is small. A rare outing in pre-Covid times included a flight to the U.K. to catch a soccer game with Henry, who’s also the principal owner of the Liverpool Football Club, as well as his wife Linda.Even their charitable giving is mostly anonymous.Fidelity, meanwhile, is ubiquitous. It manages 30.8 million brokerage accounts and more than $1.8 trillion in retirement savings. Its myriad funds hold $1.1 trillion of equities, a sum greater than 4% of the value of the S&P 500.“Next to the Kennedys they are the most important family in Boston, and who ever hears anything about them?” said John Bonnanzio, editor of newsletter Fidelity Monitor & Insight. “There’s just an endless amount of money around the Johnson family and their various trusts.”Unlike the Kennedys, the family’s politics are hard to discern. Abby donated about $330,000 to Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee in 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records. Since then, she has donated more than $14,000 to mostly Republican candidates in five states.Fidelity’s DNAOver three generations, the Johnsons have amassed the world’s 8th-biggest family fortune, and it has more than doubled in the past five years as soaring global equity markets pushed Fidelity’s revenue and operating income to records.The trend underscores the company’s success embracing low and no-cost index funds, products that are antithetical to the firm’s original bread and butter: actively managed mutual funds. It has handled the shift better than competitors like Franklin Resources Inc. and Invesco Ltd., whose market values have slumped in recent years as customers increasingly balked at high fees.“If we always focus on our customers, the business will grow and we will continue to be a strong and healthy company, which allows us to invest in our employees and customers and support charitable organizations in our communities,” Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said in an emailed statement. He declined to comment on the family’s net worth.Diversification has always been a part of Fidelity’s DNA. That’s evident in how Abby has reoriented the firm in the ever-shifting whims of finance and how the Johnsons invested their personal wealth.Most of the world’s richest clans owe their fortunes to well-stewarded companies. As they grow and throw off cash, the families usually invest the proceeds with diversification in mind, hedging against downturns in specific industries and buying easy-to-sell assets when heirs need money for a villa or to start new ventures. For a family business that makes luxury handbags, diversification might mean an index fund.So what does it mean for a family that actually makes index funds?A lot of hard assets, for starters: tangible investments like real estate and Texas shale. But it also means high-growth tech and pharmaceutical startups. Unlike many families that separate personal investments from the operating business, the Johnsons’ interests are intertwined with FMR LLC, the parent of Fidelity Investments, of which they own 49%. FMR employees hold the rest.Gummy PantsThe hodgepodge nature of FMR reflects both Ned III’s entrepreneurial leanings and the advantages of running a closely held company. With no broad base of anonymous shareholders to answer to and no stock price to worry about, the Johnsons have been able to use the entity to invest in areas unrelated to asset management.About three decades ago, Ned III set up Fidelity Capital, a division that resembled a venture capital firm, investing in assets well outside its core focus, like real estate, catering and staffing. Later — legend has it — he got gum on his pants in a taxi, so he started his own fleet in the 1980s and built it into one of the country’s largest chauffeured car services before selling it in 2013.In the 1990s, Fidelity Capital founded City of London Telecommunications, an early competitor to former state monopoly British Telecom. The Johnsons along with other FMR shareholders and Fidelity’s sister company, Fidelity International, which in turn is about 40% owned by the family, still control the $4.5 billion company, now known as Colt Group.Seaport PlaceTo see the quiet influence of the Johnson empire, look no further than the Boston seaport. Twenty-five years ago, it was a barren fishing pier bounded by crumbling parking lots. Today it’s chockablock with gleaming office towers and waterfront cafes.On a recent sweltering afternoon, a smattering of tourists and locals lounged on strips of grass that fringe the office buildings, now mostly empty. The sleepy vibe contrasts with pre-Covid times, when thousands of workers flooded the neighborhood daily.Seaport Place, a linchpin of the area’s overhaul, was the work of the Johnsons. Pembroke Real Estate, a property company run by Abby’s younger brother, Edward C. Johnson IV, manages 2.2 million square feet of office, retail and hotel space on the northern edge of once-gritty South Boston. Pembroke oversees commercial properties owned by FMR and Fidelity International, according to its website.“I grew up in South Boston and I’m very familiar with the waterfront,” said Jim Rooney, president of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. Back then, “it was not a nice place. The Johnsons and Fidelity were pioneers in seeing, before anyone else, a new development horizon for the city.”Japan, GermanyPembroke’s portfolio encompasses 8.6 million square feet, mostly offices, in 14 cities across eight countries. Its holdings grew substantially after some of them were reported in a March 2010 bond prospectus for FMR, with a carrying value of $1.6 billion.Since then, new properties have been added in Australia, Japan, Germany and the U.S. West Coast, and the portfolio is now worth an estimated $5.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The appreciation of long-held properties will help cushion the blow that the pandemic inflicted on commercial real estate. Transactions, development and inquiries from prospective tenants have plunged. In March, the Seaport Hotel furloughed 400 workers. It offered rooms free to medical workers caring for Covid patients.The health crisis has inflicted pain elsewhere in the Johnson portfolio. In West Texas, family-owned shale company Discovery Natural Resources dismissed workers amid anemic oil demand.Other assets are less exposed to pandemic fallout. The family has stakes in more than 190 companies through Cambridge, Massachusetts-based F-Prime Inc., a venture capital firm with $2 billion in committed tech and health-care investments.It was an early backer of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and has invested in Checkmate Pharmaceuticals Inc., a maker of cancer treatments that filed to go public last month. F-Prime has invested in almost three dozen Boston-area health or biotech companies.While Fidelity is known for mutual funds, it sits atop the food chain of the venture capital community in Boston because of the amount of money at its command, said Bonnanzio, the newsletter editor.“Are the best ideas on Fidelity’s radar?” he said. “It’s almost impossible that they’re not.”Eight RoadsMost of these private equity-type investments were housed under FMR’s corporate umbrella until 2018, when a restructuring aimed at simplifying the firm’s financial statements resulted in the investments being spun out, according to a report by S&P Global Ratings.A similar thing happened last year at Fidelity International, where a division called Eight Roads, which invested in real estate and private companies, was hived off into its own business.The linkages between FMR, Fidelity and the Johnsons’ personal investment vehicles are reflected in the flow of personnel. Of 38 people identified on LinkedIn as employees of their Salem, New Hampshire-based family office, Crosby, at least 13 had previously worked at Fidelity Investments.The social media site also indicates that five Crosby staffers manage the family’s art. Ned III has amassed an extensive collection of 19th and 20th century paintings, furniture and Asian art. His Brookfield Arts Foundation, whose purpose is to loan works to museums, had an asset value of $282.6 million at the end of 2018, tax filings show.Rare InterviewThe interconnectedness of various family entities is also evident in Florida, where Beth Johnson, Abby’s younger sister, runs Louisburg Farm, a training facility for show-jumping horses that’s named for an idyllic block in Boston’s Beacon Hill. Two employees — one at Fidelity and another at the Johnsons’ family office — executed deeds for the purchase of the Palm Beach-area farmland in 2001.Regardless of how their family office investments fare, odds are you won’t hear about it from a Johnson.In 2017, Abby sat for a rare interview on Bloomberg Television with Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein. She’s warm, dryly funny and engaging. Until, that is, Rubenstein asks what it’s like to have her name next to a number on a wealth ranking. She grimaces, laughs awkwardly, then bats the air as if to push away the question.“People want to speculate about things,” she said. “But I don’t think that reflects anything about who you are or how you live your life or what you do.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">","contentSnippet":"(Bloomberg) -- The wealthiest family in Yankee New England is exactly what you’d expect.The Johnsons, led by polymathic patriarch Edward “Ned” Crosby III, built a $46.3 billion fortune with Fidelity Investments, whose products shape the finances of about 32 million people worldwide.

Its holdings grew substantially after some of them were reported in a March 2010 bond prospectus for FMR, with a carrying value of $1.6 billion.Since then, new properties have been added in Australia, Japan, Germany and the U.S. West Coast, and the portfolio is now worth an estimated $5.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The appreciation of long-held properties will help cushion the blow that the pandemic inflicted on commercial real estate. Transactions, development and inquiries from prospective tenants have plunged. In March, the Seaport Hotel furloughed 400 workers. It offered rooms free to medical workers caring for Covid patients.The health crisis has inflicted pain elsewhere in the Johnson portfolio. In West Texas, family-owned shale company Discovery Natural Resources dismissed workers amid anemic oil demand.Other assets are less exposed to pandemic fallout. The family has stakes in more than 190 companies through Cambridge, Massachusetts-based F-Prime Inc., a venture capital firm with $2 billion in committed tech and health-care investments.It was an early backer of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and has invested in Checkmate Pharmaceuticals Inc., a maker of cancer treatments that filed to go public last month. F-Prime has invested in almost three dozen Boston-area health or biotech companies.While Fidelity is known for mutual funds, it sits atop the food chain of the venture capital community in Boston because of the amount of money at its command, said Bonnanzio, the newsletter editor.“Are the best ideas on Fidelity’s radar?” he said. “It’s almost impossible that they’re not.”Eight RoadsMost of these private equity-type investments were housed under FMR’s corporate umbrella until 2018, when a restructuring aimed at simplifying the firm’s financial statements resulted in the investments being spun out, according to a report by S&P Global Ratings.A similar thing happened last year at Fidelity International, where a division called Eight Roads, which invested in real estate and private companies, was hived off into its own business.The linkages between FMR, Fidelity and the Johnsons’ personal investment vehicles are reflected in the flow of personnel. Of 38 people identified on LinkedIn as employees of their Salem, New Hampshire-based family office, Crosby, at least 13 had previously worked at Fidelity Investments.The social media site also indicates that five Crosby staffers manage the family’s art. Ned III has amassed an extensive collection of 19th and 20th century paintings, furniture and Asian art. His Brookfield Arts Foundation, whose purpose is to loan works to museums, had an asset value of $282.6 million at the end of 2018, tax filings show.Rare InterviewThe interconnectedness of various family entities is also evident in Florida, where Beth Johnson, Abby’s younger sister, runs Louisburg Farm, a training facility for show-jumping horses that’s named for an idyllic block in Boston’s Beacon Hill. Two employees — one at Fidelity and another at the Johnsons’ family office — executed deeds for the purchase of the Palm Beach-area farmland in 2001.Regardless of how their family office investments fare, odds are you won’t hear about it from a Johnson.In 2017, Abby sat for a rare interview on Bloomberg Television with Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein. She’s warm, dryly funny and engaging. Until, that is, Rubenstein asks what it’s like to have her name next to a number on a wealth ranking. She grimaces, laughs awkwardly, then bats the air as if to push away the question.“People want to speculate about things,” she said. “But I don’t think that reflects anything about who you are or how you live your life or what you do.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","guid":"fidelity-family-vast-wealth-matched-160009141.html","isoDate":"2020-08-03T16:00:09.000Z"},{"title":"Pan American Silver increases La Colorada skarn deposit mineral resource estimate to 100.4 million tonnes and provides drilling update","link":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pan-american-silver-increases-la-115500561.html","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:55:00 -0400","content":"<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pan-american-silver-increases-la-115500561.html\"><img src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IZh4ZVfMMVQen...sCpRug--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnwgroup.com/47c713275404eaa862a1d59fcd71a0aa\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"Pan American Silver increases La Colorada skarn deposit mineral resource estimate to 100.4 million tonnes and provides drilling update\" align=\"left\" title=\"Pan American Silver increases La Colorada skarn deposit mineral resource estimate to 100.4 million tonnes and provides drilling update\" border=\"0\" ></a>VANCOUVER, BC, Aug. 4, 2020 /CNW/ - Pan American Silver Corp.<p><br clear=\"all\">","contentSnippet":"VANCOUVER, BC, Aug. 4, 2020 /CNW/ - Pan American Silver Corp.","guid":"pan-american-silver-increases-la-115500561.html","isoDate":"2020-08-04T11:55:00.000Z"},{"title":"Why Gold’s Upward run Is Unlikely to Last Long","link":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gold-upward-run-unlikely-064757864.html","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 02:47:57 -0400","content":"<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gold-upward-run-unlikely-064757864.html\"><img src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N6tqwPRtTOpxe.0lSmGGUQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/e06e6ac65222424c524087f1f5376dc6\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"Why Gold’s Upward run Is Unlikely to Last Long\" align=\"left\" title=\"Why Gold’s Upward run Is Unlikely to Last Long\" border=\"0\" ></a>Gold futures price had been relatively stable in recent days on expectations of more stimuli from the world’s largest economy with a pending USD1 trillion fiscal stimulus package awaiting passage from U.S Congress.<p><br clear=\"all\">","contentSnippet":"Gold futures price had been relatively stable in recent days on expectations of more stimuli from the world’s largest economy with a pending USD1 trillion fiscal stimulus package awaiting passage from U.S Congress.","guid":"why-gold-upward-run-unlikely-064757864.html","isoDate":"2020-08-04T06:47:57.000Z"},{"title":"Did Hedge Funds Make The Right Call On B2Gold Corp (BTG) ?","link":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-hedge-funds-call-b2gold-152739184.html","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 11:27:39 -0400","content":"<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-hedge-funds-call-b2gold-152739184.html\"><img src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JfdezzwurmR9jpbB3c.kGQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/insidermonkey.com/c92746c3d2f9abb725b99f3c1c8a8123\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"Did Hedge Funds Make The Right Call On B2Gold Corp (BTG) ?\" align=\"left\" title=\"Did Hedge Funds Make The Right Call On B2Gold Corp (BTG) ?\" border=\"0\" ></a>The latest 13F reporting period has come and gone, and Insider Monkey have plowed through 821 13F filings that hedge funds and well-known value investors are required to file by the SEC.

In yesterday’s tech rally, the electric heavy-truck maker surged by 22%.Was the surge in anticipation of a “home run” report? Hardly. In fact, results wise there will be very little to tell investors, as Nikola has no product yet and isn’t expected to have anything to sell until the second half of next year at the earliest.However, there were several reasons for the rally. One was a note to investors from Deutsche Bank, in which analyst Emmanuel Rosner added the company to its short-term Catalyst Call Buy List.Rosner recommends investors pull the trigger on NKLA shares in anticipation of updates from Executive Chairman and founder Trevor Milton.Maybe Nikola has little to show for now, but Milton has taken a leaf out of the mercurial entrepreneur playbook. The founder has already exhibited all the hallmarks of an adept showman, with a flair for headline grabbing antics. The latest of which was a tweet reassuring investors as to the health of Nikola’s balance sheet. The savvy move helped push the share price higher, too.So, what does Rosner expect Milton to reveal that instigated the Buy Idea?“We see catalysts occurring with Nikola’s earnings report this week,” the analyst said, “Including: customers for its BEV truck; commercial partner for the hydrogen stations; OEM manufacturing partner; and an updated Badger reservations count . Beyond it, some or all of the above company updates could come in the next couple months. We are targeting a 10-20% return for this Catalyst Call.” It will be interesting to see how much battery power there will be left to push shares higher after yesterday’s surge. To this end, Rosner has a $54 price target on the stock, implying there’s a 42% upside in the cards. Additionally, as mentioned, Rosner’s Hold rating makes a switch to a “short term” Buy. (To watch Rosner’s track record, click here)There’s similar sentiment among Rosner’s colleagues. 2 Buys and Holds each, add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $56.67, the average price target could provide gains of 55% over the coming months.

As uncertainty over the future remains, many Americans who may have been thinking of listing their homes are staying put until a more clear trajectory of the housing market is known.Now while there may not be an abundance of houses on the market, there are many buyers. In an attempt to stimulate economic growth, The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to record-breaking lows. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped below 3%.

Using a mortgage calculator, if you were to buy a 30-year fixed mortgage for $200,000 at a 6% interest rate your monthly mortgage would be $1,199.
